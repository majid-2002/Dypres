##### Dynamic Presentation using Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Project Topic: Automated presentation using Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence

Our project takes the concept of presentation to the next level by dynamically generating them based on real time speech input. We use a speech to text engine to convert the speech into text. Then we use natural language processing to extract meaningful data from the text. Based on this data, we collect media files and information from the internet. We then use AI to select the necessary content and create dynamic presentations.

This process allows us to create presentations that are tailored to the specific needs of the audience, and that can be updated on the fly to ensure that the most relevant and up-to-date information is always being presented. This is a major step forward from traditional presentations, which are often static and outdated by the time they are presented.

Our system has a number of advantages over existing solutions. First, it is completely automated, meaning that there is no need for manual input from the user. Second, it is highly scalable, meaning that it can be used for presentations of any size and complexity. Finally, it is very flexible, meaning that it can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of any organization.
